# Solar-Energy-Forecast

- This analysis is a capstone project for my introductory class of Data Analytics
- Forecasting solar energy is an important task to manage solar power systems, ensure power supply, and reduce operational risks. 
In this study, several machine learning models were compared in order to predict solar power from a power plant in Berkeley, California. 
The methodology in this study was applied using a distributed computing framework on Apache Spark. 
Data was collected from public databases and includes weather measurements recorded in 2008 and 2009. 
The results show that the random forest regression algorithm performed the best for predicting solar power, with an R-squared value of 89%. 
Finally, this model allowed for the identification of  which weather parameters are most important in predicting solar power.
