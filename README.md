## Predicting Solar Energy production from weather parameters

In this study, several machine learning models were compared in order to predict solar power using weather features. I collected, processed and merged weather data from the [National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/4-15) and solar energy production data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vipulgote4/solar-power-generation) database. The objective of this project is the analysis of which weather features are most representative to predict solar energy, modelling and tunning machine learning models using Spark. The results were presented in my Data Analytics Foundations class at GWU. 

Project highlights:
-	Machine learning implementation in Spark
-	Model deployment with MLflow and Streamlit (coming soon....)
-	Decision Tree best prediction metrics: RMSE = 3412, R-squared = 0.92
